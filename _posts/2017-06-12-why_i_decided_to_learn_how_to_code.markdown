I think that this is an exciting time to enter the tech industry. With progress being made in artificial intelligence/machine learning, 3D printing, and software, I am interested in how these advancements in technology will continue to shape the future of the world. What challenges and crisis will be solved or mitigated by the use of technology? I am especially drawn to how I can contribute to solving some of these problems. I am elated about the possibility tech offers that I have read Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotlerâ€™s books *Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think* and *Bold: How to Go Big, Create** *Wealth and Impact The World* as well as listened to tech podcast online such as Pando Monthly, This Week In Startups, Startup Grind, and NPRs How I Built This podcasts. My ultimate goal is to begin a startup that either solves a problem or enhance the lives of those who use my product.

What excites me most about code is the ability to turn an idea into a product you believe can be useful or interesting to a group of people and get immediate feedback from users. Ultimately, coding makes ideas tangible.
